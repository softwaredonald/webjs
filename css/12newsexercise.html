    <h1 class="cen" id="h-1">Peter Dutton resigns ministerial position after leadership challenge</h1>

    <p class="main"> He put his hand up to lead the party after <a href="#" id="a-1">Mr Turnbull</a> declared the leadership position
        vacant this morning.</p>
    <p class="main"> While Mr Turnbull won the spill by 48 votes to 35, it’s unlikely the vote will settle the matter. Mr Dutton indicated
        as much after the vote, resigning his position as minister to sit on the backbench. This will give Mr Dutton the
        freedom to lobby for more support from his colleagues and to criticise decisions of the Cabinet.</p>
    <p class="main">After the leadership spill, Sky News Australia reporter Ashleigh Gillon said “it’s not over” and noted that Mr Turnbull
        had only won the ballot by seven votes.If successful, Mr Dutton would be Australia’s sixth prime minister in 11 years.
        However, Mr Dutton does have his challenges, including doubt over whether he has a right to sit in parliament.</p>
    <p class="main"> According to Ten Eyewitness News, <a href="#" id="a-1">Mr Dutton</a> could be disqualified from parliament as two
        child care centres he owns via a trust have been receiving direct subsidies from the government. Parliamentarians
        are not allowed to have any direct or indirect pecuniary interests with the Public Service of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p class="main">It was the same rule that brought down Family First Senator Bob Day last year. Mr Dutton will also have to face accusations
        that he is a puppet of former prime minister Tony Abbott and is also a figure not familiar to many Australians.</p>
